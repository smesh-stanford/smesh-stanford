Here is where to find all the resources you might desire for SMesh. </br></br>For background, environmental sensors are currently insufficient for monitoring controlled burns. They are too expensive, too difficult to deploy, too permanent, or do not track all the critical variables. <br/> <br/> SMesh is a low-cost, easily deployable sensor suite that helps fire practitioners stay out of harmâ€™s way, extend their reach across multiple sites, and access sensor data before, during, and after a burn. </center>"
